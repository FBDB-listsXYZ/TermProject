            <p>    Welcome to my website. I wanted to use this page to just share a few thing about myself.<br></p>
            <p>Unlike the majority of the people at this school I don't have a job path that I am set on although I do feel prepared for whatever path life takes me down. 
                Because of this I don't want to dedicate my website to my future career.
                Instead I just want to talk about some things that interest me. I am a huge soccer fan and player. I play on the team here and that is what I do in most of my free time. 
                I enjoy skiing and hiking back home in Colorado and I am somewhat involved in a charity group in Haiti called <a id="link2" href="https://fonkoze.org/clm" >CLM</a>
             although I was definatly more involved with them in high school. I have attached some videos and pictues below about soccer and my dog.</p>

<!--This changed my page significantly by centralizing my text more which gave it some more appeal. I didn't apply to grid to the picture though so that remains towards the left.-->
